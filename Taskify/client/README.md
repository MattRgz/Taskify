# Taskify is a "To Do List"
coded as a project for my bootcamp. You can create a profile and manage the list with products previusly created.

# The project is builded with react
To start, you have to type "npm start" on client, and start the server with "nodemon start" command (if you don't have nodemon, you can start it in the classic way).
